# Roid's Tweaker
Roidrole's CraftTweaker addon. 

With this mod, I aim to include and improve upon dead and/or broken CT addons. So far, this mod is a drop-in replacement for : 
- CraftTweaker Integration, by TCreograph (included), where I fixed [#10](https://github.com/TCreopargh/CraftTweakerIntegration/issues/10) and [#11](https://github.com/TCreopargh/CraftTweakerIntegration/issues/11), added mapEMC for single items and fixed, expanded ArrayUtils, MutableString, DataUtil and Bauble Support
- Extra Tweaker, by blue_beaker (Rewritten with same API)
- MekaTweaker, by Lorexe (included), where I implemented [#6](https://github.com/Lorexe/MekaTweaker/issues/6)
- Thermal Expansion Specialization Hooks, by JoshieGemFinder (Rewritten with same API)

I also included the functionalities of the following mods, with varying levels of modification :
- CraftTweakerUtils, by BrisingrAerowing (included), where I disabled duplicate content (with CT and CTI) and made some ZenClasses ZenExpansions
- Immersive Engineering Tweaks, by ZhilBear (simplified logic, ZenExpansion instead of new class)
- Immersive Tweaker, by brisingraerowing (copied and improved functionality, ZenExpansion instead of a new class)
- Random Things Tweaker (rewritten)
- Rocky Tweaks, by Mohron (rewritten)
- Tweaked, by SnowdoniaGames (reimplemented functionality not in ModTweaker with CT)
- VanillaAnvilRepair, by eksekk (only CT functionality)
- Villager Trade Tables, by crazysnailboy (added functionality via CT)
- ZenCloche, by SmokeyTheBandicoot (rewritten)

There are also a few original additions :
- Bubbles support (clone of GS + making any item a bauble with custom behavior)
- Config file support (creation, reading)
- Factory0-Resources support
- Forge registry blacklist
- IData storage in a file
- Immersive Engineering Blueprint list and villager trade
- ProjectE custom fuels
- More villager and anvil methods
