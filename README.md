# Roid's Tweaker
Roidrole's CraftTweaker addon. 

With this mod, I aim to include and improve upon dead and broken CT addons. So far, this mod includes and is a drop-in replacement for : 
- CraftTweaker Integration, by TCreograph, where I fixed [#10](https://github.com/TCreopargh/CraftTweakerIntegration/issues/10) and [#11](https://github.com/TCreopargh/CraftTweakerIntegration/issues/11)
- MekaTweaker, by Lorexe, where I implemented [#6](https://github.com/Lorexe/MekaTweaker/issues/6)

I also included the functionalities of the following mods, which were either used as inspiration or completely rewritten : 
- Rocky Tweaker, by Mohron (rewritten entirely)
- Villager Trade Tables, by crazysnailboy (added functionality via CT)
- VanillaAnvilRepair (only CT functionality), by eksekk
